    <h2>Mavrck Happy Hour</h2>

 <p>
  On the 28th I went to the Mavrck happy hour meetup at the 4th floor atrium. It was really casual and fun and I talked to a lot of people from both in and out of our own cohort. The first person I met was Matt, a g55 student working on his capstone project.  Its an online coop survival game that uses a command line interface. It sounds really cool and right up my alley- I'm excited to try it out. It seems like a game that is basically without graphics will be completely dependent on the quality and creativity of its writing and challenges, so I'm really interested to see how well he pulled it off. I asked Matt a few JavaScript-related questions and learned a few things. One is that it's probably unnecessary to learn JQuery at this point in time because other frameworks can do the same more easily- at least that's how I understood it with my limited knowledge. He also gave me a couple tips on syntax, one being that it's fine to use back-ticks for all quotation marks in JS, but definitly not in other languages, and the other being that you don't really need to use semicolons for lne breaks. If whoever is grading this disagrees with any of these tips I'd be interested to hear why- I'm always looking for different perspectives on things.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another person I met was Dominic, a grad from Galvanize GT who now works as a developer at Starz. We talked about a lot of different stuff, and he gave me a few tips related to development. One was to make sure the company is a good fit culturally before aceepting a job offer, which might seem obvious but he reminded me to retain a sense a sense of self-worth and not get desperate and take an offer that isn't a good fit just because my job search might me taking longer than I'd like. This is definitely advice I'll carry with me going forward, although I don't feel even remotely ready to think about taking a job in tech yet. Another thing Dominic told me is just to put a ton of time and effort into getting really good with vanilla JavaScript if I'm ever wondering what to focus on. This is definitely consistent with the overall impression I've been getting which is that right now, strong JS skills will go a long way as a web developer.
 </p>
 <p>
  One question I have right now Is whether these types of social happy hour meetups will be more beneficial to me at this point as opposed to more formal ones. My instinct is that they will as long I have the confidence to approach people and start conversations. I have a hard time staying focused on sitting and listening to speakers for long periods of time, and a lot of the topics being discussed at meetups would go completely over my head at this point anyway. I can definitely see the benefit of both types of meetups but I'm not sure which I'll end up enjoying more in the long run.

    <h2>CannaTech Denver Meetup</h2>

  <p>
  Last Thursday I attended the CannaTech Denver meetup at Finn's Manor. It's a meetup for developers currently working with the cannabis industry or looking to do so. The atmosphere of the meetup was very casual and there were no formal speakers, just a couple dozen or so developers and weed industry people with nametags standing around socializing. I wasn't sure how much I'd get out of this meetup since I didn't know anyone there and am not usually very outgoing, but luckily I did end up meeting a few new people and having some enlightening conversation.
  </p>

  <p>
  The first person I met was Travis Nelson, a partner and developer at Moonsault Software. He works primarily on the back end, and asked what back end technologies we're learning at Galvanize to which I replied Node and Express and that I don't yet have much of an idea what either of those actually are (I sort of do now!). I asked him how he got into coding and he said that he initially wanted to make games but has yet to actually make one. I found that interesting because I got into it for the same reason, but prior to starting Galvanize, making games was pretty much the only coding I had actually done. A piece of advice he gave me, which goes against what other people have generally said, was to not worry too much about learning and incorporating new technologies when it comes to real projects for clients with deadlines. The client usually doesn't care or understand much about what's going on under the hood as long as the application works on most browsers/devices and is delivered on time. This advice makes sense to me since he was talking about making deadlines, not saying that I shouldn't bother learning new technologies at all.
  </p>

  <p>
  I also met James, a developer working for a cannabis company called Lightshade. We didn't get to talk for too long but he gave me the same advice that several other working developers have which is that I should probably focus really hard on mastering JavaScript at this point in my career, since it's so foundational and can be used on both the front and back end. He also reminded me to work on things that interest me to avoid getting burnt out. It's good to know a lot of different stuff but trying to learn everything can just be frustrating and unproductive.
  </p>

  <p>
  The main question I had going into the meetup, which I unfortunately didn't get to talk to anyone about, Is how homogenous the technologies currently being used by the industry are, since it seems to me that most of these companies operate in a very similar way and would therefore have mostly the same needs. And with how much consolidation is currently going on in the CO weed industry, what is the potential for one complany to come up with a solution that most of them end up using and thereby become incredibly rich? I'll have to keep asking people in this industry if I want to find answers to these questions.

    <h2>Develop Denver Happy Hour</h2>

  <p>
  On Tuesday, November 14th, I attended the Develop Denver meetup at tap XIV on Blake st. It was another casual, happy hour style meetup with a bunch of dorks standing around drinking and socializing. Most of g70 was there, as well as a bunch of Galvanize alumni. I met a lot of people and good times were had.
  </p>

  <p>
  One of the first people I met was Cody, who works on the Sprint UX podcast with Kyle. He enlightened me on their innovative podcasting technique, which involves recording seven episodes in one day, getting progressively more drunk as the day goes on. I can imagine this helps tremendously with focus and brevity. I also met Devin, a Golden Triangle grad, who is now a developer at a company whose name I can't remember. He warned me that Kyle is a scumbag and to stay far away. Another person I met was Jesse, a data analyst who works for Sony. He was super interesting and explained a bit about machine learning to me, something I'm really curious about but don't have much of an understanding of. He basically described it as the ability for code to self-optimize using massive amounts of data combined with pattern recognition and lots of other methods. Obviously there's much more to it but I felt like I learned a lot from our conversation. I spoke to quite a few other new people but the details of our conversations are pretty hazy in my mind. Thanks alcohol!
  </p>

  <p>
  I have a lot more questions about data science after my conversation with Jesse and am definitely going to do some independent research on the topic. One of the main this I'm wondering is- how many people work simultaneously as data scientists and web developers? There's clearly a lot of overlap in the two professions but I'm curious about the actual feasibility of doing both at the same time. I'll probably also have to check out some of those drunken episodes of the Sprint podcast. This was a really fun meetup and I'm definitely planning to go again next month.
