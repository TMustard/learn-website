    <h2>Learning CLI and Git</h2>
<p>
10/23/2017

  On Sunday I worked on finishing up the Git drills we were assigned. I ate and made some tea, then let the girlfriend know that I was going to need a couple hours free of distraction if she can help it. Our apartment is pretty small so she was still watching TV right next to my desk but I put some headphones on and queued up a lengthy playlist of some low-intensity music which I find really helps me stay focused and positive as long as the genre of music is right. I usually pick classical or certain types of jazz and electronic music. I also made sure to turn notifications off and close any unnecessary tabs in my browser.
</p>
<p>
  I was a bit confused about the "what" and "why" of learning CLI and Git when we were frst introduced to it, but after some explanation and playing around with it a bit, it makes perfect sense why we're starting with this and not diving straight into something like html/css. Getting proficient with this stuff now will make the whole development pipeline go much faster and smoother so I was motivated and ready to get some practice in.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to that and my stage setting, I finished up drill 2 pretty quickly and without many stumbling blocks, and got started on drill 3, which also went quickly until I got to the end. I couldn't figure out why I had completed the drill using four fewer steps than the number I was told to show in the command history file. It seemed to me that I had done everything I'd been told to do, so I went ahead and submitted it, and will probably hear back what I did wrong when it gets graded. Two things I could have done differently would have been to finish the drills during class on Friday so tht I could just ask someone why I was missing commands, or ask in Slack on Sunday night. If I hadn't been working on my personal webpage to present it on Friday, I would've definitely been able to finish during class hours, so one thing I took away was that it's really important to stay caught up so that I don't have to work from home as much.
</p>
<p>
  Overall I enjoyed practicing CLI and git commands over the course of these drills and getting faster, and am looking forward to becoming a wizard who can whip up complex repos and push them to Github faster than I can blink.

<h2>Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
<p>
  Today I worked on learning HTML and CSS. It's imperative to have a solid understanding of these languages to be able to design good front ends, so I wanted to get started on them as soon as possible. I find both pretty fun to fiddle around with- I used to love tinkering with UI mods for video games and front end design reminds me a lot of that, just more complex which makes it even more enjoyable, although it can also be a bit frustrating as a beginner when you can't get things to look the way you want them to. That's part of the learning process though, and makes finally getting it right that much more rewarding.
</p>
<p>
  I set the stage by deciding a set amount of time I was going to work on this particular subject, and quickly clancing over the different parts of the assessment to give myself an idea of how long I would need to complete all of it. I planned what times I would take breaks and for how long, and took the usual steps of closing unneeded tabs in my browser, turning notifications off, and putting on some relaxing music. I also went up to the 3rd floor for part of the day so I could work alone and have no distractions. I think this helped quite a bit to enable me to just mess around with different things in both languages without getting distracted or feeling self-conscious. Tomorrow I'll probably stay in the classroom because I want to be able to ask some questions to my peers and instructors.
</p>
<p>
  I'm excited to keep pushing forward with these technologies as well as others like JS so I can really start making some nice looking stuff. I've been impressed by some of the personal websites other students have made and can't wait to reach that level and beyond in the near future.

<h2>Learning to play Marvel vs. Capcom on Hitbox controller</h2>
<p>
  10/23/2017

  Over the weekend I worked on learning to play fighting games on a Hitbox. It's a controller that uses buttons for all directional inputs instead of a joystick or directional pad. The reason for using this strange contraption is that it enables your motions to be much quicker and more precise, especially for actions like blocking or dashing. I've barely played with the controller since I got it due to being so busy with web development stuff, but once you get accustomed to it, there's a number of shortcuts you can use for motions like the 'Shoryuken' which enable you to execute the move so much faster and easier that it could almost be considered cheating. The game I'm practicing in is Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.
</p>
<p>
  To set the stage for practicing fighting games I always put on some electronic music with a steady beat, make sure the girlfriend isn't home or is occupied with something, then go into training mode and practice some of my most commonly used combos before queueing up to face a human opponent online. In this case I stayed in training mode for about 30 minutes before going online since I'm still adjusting to the new input method and not super confident with it. This definitely helped, and my movement and combo execution were looking decent once I did get into a match with another player. I'm definitely still not as good with the Hitbox than I would be with a normal joystick, but I think it'll pay off if I stick with it.
</p>
<p>
  I doubt that I'll often have time to play video games while doing Galvanize, but in the long term I'm excited to master this control method, as I've already found some interesting things I can execute with it that would be almost impossible with any other controller, and I've always really enjoyed fighting games. I won't likely win any tournaments in the near future, but it's a fun hobby with a near limitless skill cap that I'll probably pursue on a casual level for many years to come.
