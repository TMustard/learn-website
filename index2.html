    <h2>Day 1 Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li class= "day">Stay focused on important tasks throughout the day, taking breaks when needed.</li>
  <li  class= "day">Submit at least three drills by the end of the day.</li>
  <li  class= "day">Start a conversation with somebody in the cohort I haven't spoken to very much.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I think I did pretty well on goal 1. In retrospect this isn't the most specific or measurable goal, but I've often struggled with staying focused, and I got a lot done today, rarely if ever felt distracted, and managed to finish a book I've been reading for quite a while during one of the breaks I took. I'd say I definitely met this goal, and if I can continue to stay focused on my goals without burning myself out for the next six months then I should be in a really good place.
</p>
 <p>
  Goal 2 also went well, this will be the fifth drill I've submitted today and I also worked on HTML/CSS a bit.
</p>
<p>
  Goal 3 I didn't really meet, I made a little conversation at my table but worked alone all day and didn't stay after class for beers. I wasn't feeling in a very conversational mood and was a bit stressed about falling behind on HTML and CSS. Realizing that I'd been excluded from breakouts because I hadn't turned in as many drills as some others got me kind of worried that I'm going to keep falling further and further behind other people. In the future I need to not let small stuff like this get to me so much, because it's not like I can't easily catch up and ask for help when I need it.</p>

    <h2>Day 2 Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li class= "day">Finish watching the breakout video for the semantic HTML video and layout with HTML/CSS videos and successfully absorb everything being talked about.</li>
  <li  class= "day">Make significant progress on the first HTML/CSS drill, to where it looks like I can finish either tonight or tomorrow.</li>
  <li  class= "day">Start a conversation with somebody in the cohort I haven't spoken to very much.</li>
</ul>
 <p>
  I feel I did really well with goal 1. These breakout videos are a huge boon to me, because even if I'm present for the breakout, my mind tends to wander and I often miss out on important details because of that. If these videos weren't archived for us, I would have had a really hard time completing the first HTML/CSS drill.</p>
 <p>
  I finished the drill thanks to completing Goal 1, as well as asking questions in class the next day, since I got stuck on a few things. Completing it gave me a great feeling of satisfaction and confidence about being able to do well in this course, which is really good because yesterday I was feeling a lot of stress and self-doubt. This is still only the beginning but if I can continue to not be overcome with negative thoughts, I think I'll be ok.
</p>
<p>
  Goal 3 I think I did a better job at than yesterday, I spoke a decent amount with the person sitting next to me and got some really good advice from her on completing the first HTML drill. I could still do a lot better in this area, and there's a few things I can think of that would help. My overall mood coming into class is the main issue, and the first thing I can do to improve on that is to get more sleep each night. Second is to eat a better breakfast and eat better overall, and lastly I feel I need to put a more concentrated effort into clearing my mind of stress and self-doubt. I think this coud be a cumulative effect of the practices mentioned previously, as well as new things I could try like meditation, exercise, and stimulating conversation with a variety of different types of people. I think these could all contribute to me being a better, more well-rounded person equipped to deal with the challenges presented by Galvanize, life as a developer and life in general. It's important to keep reminding myself of all this, which these writing exercises are great at doing.
</p>

    <h2>Day 3 Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li class= "day">
    Finish and submit the first Javascript drill.
  </li>
  <li  class= "day">
    Study functions and loops until I feel I can complete the next drill and fully understand everything going on in the code.
  </li>
  <li  class= "day">
    Attend g55 capstone presentations and think critically about each project and what it does, possibly absorbing some ideas to be incorporated into my own work.
  </li>
</ul>
 <p>
  I completed goal 1, partially thanks to the excellent breakout Kim did on that topic. I feel like I pretty much understand everything going on in that drill which I'm very happy about because it was really confusing to me at the start.
</p>
 <p>
  Goal 2 was more of a struggle, and while I fell like I've come a long way in my understanding of Javascript I'm still struggling pretty badly to finish the next two drills. I've been spending a lot of time studying on my own and while that's helped, I think I need to be a lot more proactive about asking for help when I need it. We only need to understand certain concepts to solve the problems presented by the drills, and while learning Javascript from the ground up definitely isn't a bad thing, it's not expected of us at this point and not necessary to complete the drills. If I just reach out to people a lot more to solve specific problems instead of trying to teach myself everything I'll be a lot better off.
</p>
<p>
  Goal 3 went really well except for the fact that I drank several beers over the course of the evening, so by the end of the presentations my critical thinking ability was probably a bit diminished. I could've probably gotten more out of it by not drinking at all, which I'm going to plan on for the next round of capstone presentations. I think this will help a lot with absorbing ideas and remembering the presentations clearly.
